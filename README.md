# Double_Linked_List_Implementation

dllstructure.c to implement structure and tester.sh to compile and run the executable 
The dllstructure.c creates a structure Node which has the following data members: int 
data member to hold the data in each element,a pointer to Node to hold the pointer to 
the next element and a pointer to Node to hold the pointer to the previous element.

print_dll function loops over all the elements n the lsit and prints their values to 
the screen.

insert_after function inserts a new elements in the linked list after the first occurence
of the value provided by the second argument and having the value provided in the third 
argument 

delete_element function deletes the first occurence of the value provided in the second 
argument

sort_dll function sorts the elements in ascending order (uses bubble sort as its simplest
to implement)
